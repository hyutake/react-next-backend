Backend repo for react-next-ts - basically the same backend as react-game, but in typescript


Note that each folder contains a separate backend 'server' for a particular purpose, e.g. user authentication, handling game logic etc.

Instructions to run:
<ol>
    <li>Run npm install (if necessary) and then npm start for each folder</li>
    <li>Existing account: user = test, pass = test123</li>
</ol>
